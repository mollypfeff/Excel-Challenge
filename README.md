# Excel-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Module 1 Challenge due on 10/21. 
All of the work present has been created by myself, Molly Pfefferkorn.
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.


The project involves analyzing a dataset of 1,000 crowdfunding campaigns to identify trends and patterns that may determine their success or failure. In my GitHub repository, I have organized the data in an Excel workbook, where I applied different Excel functions to extract meaningful insights. I started by using conditional formatting to color-code the "Outcome" column based on campaign status (success, failure, cancellation, or live) and the "Percent Funded" column using a three-color scale to indicate progress toward funding goals. Additionally, I calculated "Percent Funded" and "Average Donation" by creating new columns with formulas. I also split the combined "Category and Sub-category" column into two separate columns: "Category" and "Sub-Category".

For analysis, I created pivot tables and stacked column charts to evaluate the outcome of campaigns per category and sub-category, with the ability to filter data by country. Using Unix timestamp conversion formulas, I transformed the "launched_at" and "deadline" columns into standard date formats and created new columns for these conversions. I also generated pivot tables and line graphs to visualize trends in campaign outcomes based on launch dates.

I further analyzed the correlation between crowdfunding goals and success rates by creating a table with goal ranges and calculating success, failure, and cancellation percentages, and created a line graph comparing the goal amount of a campaign to its outcome. I performed a statistical analysis on the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns, calculating measures like mean, median, and standard deviation to assess variability. Lastly, in my written report, I summarized three conclusions from the data, acknowledged dataset limitations, and proposed potential additional analyses.
